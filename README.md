Training of an neural machine tranlsation model as described in Jointly Learning to Align and Translate with Transformer Models (Garg et al., 2019).

The colab notebook includes the necessary steps to prepare the data and is adopted from https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/joint_alignment_translation

# Instructions 
Open the notebook, prepare the data and save it for training the model.
The model has to be trained locally or in cloud as it exceeds colabs maximum runtime.
